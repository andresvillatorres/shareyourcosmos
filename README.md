TOWARDS SOCIAL OPEN DATA

COVID-19 has affected us all, COVID-19 will change the lives of all of us. The creative collective HAUSAMMEHR would like to document these historical times together with you. Share your impressions, your fears, worries, but also joys. Share your thoughts, feelings and ideas. Share your newly created "micro" cosmos. Whether through video, audio, text, drawings or photography, #shareyourcosmos. HAUSAMMEHR has set itself the task of producing a socially relevant documentary film and an unprecedented art installation that could hardly be more real. The aim is to artistically process authentic recordings, to preserve and to strengthen the awareness of this historical moment for all future generations. Let us share this time together, even if we are spatially apart. Let the future know how we have felt and lived. Let us make art and history together! #shareyourcosmos

You can contribute by uploading any kind of content from your everyday life in video, audio, image or text format. By uploading hereby you agree with the terms and conditions from #shareyourcosmos. Please read these carefully through the following link before uploading it to our crowd-cloud.

We believe that social data is a public and common good. Through the last decades, this kind of data has been highly monopolized and we are all responsible for that. #shareyourcosmos is a crowd-repository maintained by HAUSAMMEHR which has the intention to document our everyday lives during this historical period and to keep it accessible to everyone for (social, anthropological, historical...) research and art practices. If you wish to get free access to the repository, to see how others go through these days and to start your research or art project with this data, please contact Andr√©s (andresvillatorres@gmail.com) or Chris (chris@masslersantiago.com).
